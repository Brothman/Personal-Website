  Benji's Personal Website is a central hub for Benji's projects and writings. The web application offers an easy-to-use and attractive UI  for users who want to learn more about Benji Rothman.

## Access
You can [access](http://brainy-cow.surge.sh) the site at <http://benjirothman.com>

## Key Features

#### Landing Page Loading Animation

I implemented a simple CSS animation combined with a two-second `setTimeout()` on the Landing Page. This offers the illusion of loading as the user enters the site. I remove the `setTimeout()` with `clearTimeout()` if the user navigates to another portion of the website before the two-seconds pass. 

#### Google Doc Embedding

Benji's Personal Website implements embedded Google Docs to display writings. This allows for an easy, attractive, and responsive Rich Text rendering of written content. 

#### CSS Grid Responsiveness

Benji's Personal Website utilizes CSS Grid technology to enhance the web application's responsiveness. When you visit the site from a phone, tablet or desktop, you will find a crisp UI designed to please your eye. Enjoy!

## Future Features

#### Project Enigma

I want to add some cool functionality to the website. I do not, as of yet, know what that will be. If you have any ideas, please reach out to me. 

#### Fast Initial Loading

I want to peform research about how to offer the fastest initial load time for a user with weak processing power (e.g. old smartphone or computer).


#### Interactive Themes

Offer a Graphical User Interface where users can control the color palette (theme) of the website.
